# Gjøre

Gjøre builds on top of the [Make](https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/) theme to create an anti-pattern free creation experience primarily for using [LifterLMS](https://lifterlms.com/) to create online courses. It accomplishes the following:

- Replaces custom freeware editor with the Gutengurg editor
- It hides the annoying upselling in the backend
- Styles LifterLMS objects to fit in with the rest of the theme
